The purpose of our study was to implement the published model of

Fridlyand LE, Philipson LH (2016) Pancreatic Beta Cell G-Protein
Coupled Receptors and Second Messenger Interactions: A Systems Biology
Computational Analysis. PLoS One 11:e0152869
http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152869

on MATLAB. We were interested in modeling the insulin secreting
pancreatic beta cell environment which includes membrane mechanisms, G
protein coupled receptor mechanisms, cAMP and PLC pathway and
cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium dynamics.

To run the code

The code is written in matlab. There are 3 sections in this code and
all together there are 43 graphs.  All graphs are not needed at the
same time. So for simplicity we have commented all the graphs and the
user should remove the comments as desired. To run, open matlab and
for example, type

final_code

on the matlab command prompt.
